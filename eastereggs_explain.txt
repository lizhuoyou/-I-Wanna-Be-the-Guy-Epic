Eastereggs:
1. In chapter 1, the player can jump on the roof and go on top of the question block. The question block will transport the player to a hidden chapter that goes straight to chapter 3. And if you fall in that chapter, you will not die; instead, you will be transported to the top of chapter 1.

2. In chapter 2, the player is able to jump on the roof of the cave and skip all of the traps, going right to the end. A "superminion" is set to be on the top of the cave, so the player must throw the staff 10 times at the mob to kill it before going throw.

3. In chapter 3, a hidden easter egg can be activated when the player goes throw the second pipe count from the right. The player will then be transported to a map that does nothing but to say: "hello world".

4. In the guide_screen menu, the user can press the "Here Lies" text and goes to a screen that shows the credit of the developers.
